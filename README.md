<strong>Course:</strong> SECP 1513 – Technology Information and System<br>
<strong>Date:</strong> 20 November 2025<br>
<strong>Time:</strong> 2:00 p.m.



This repository documents my learning experience from the <strong>PPG Industry Talk</strong>,
which was organised to introduce students to the real-world applications of
<strong>paint and coating technologies</strong> in various industries. PPG is a global company
specialising in paints, coatings, and specialty materials, serving sectors such as
automotive, aerospace, construction, and consumer goods.



During the talk, I learned that coatings are not only used for aesthetic purposes but
also play a crucial role in <strong>protection, durability, and sustainability</strong>. The speaker
explained how coatings help protect surfaces from corrosion, environmental damage, and
wear, making them essential in both industrial and everyday applications.



The session also highlighted <strong>PPG’s focus on technology and innovation</strong>, particularly
its strong investment in <strong>research and development (R&amp;D)</strong>. PPG continuously develops
advanced coatings with improved durability, colour retention, and environmental
friendliness, demonstrating how innovation drives success in the coating industry.



Another important aspect discussed was <strong>sustainability</strong>. PPG aims to reduce
environmental impact by using sustainable raw materials and energy-efficient
manufacturing processes. Examples shared during the talk included <strong>water-based paints,
recyclable packaging, and long-lasting coatings</strong> that reduce maintenance needs and
environmental waste.



In addition, the talk introduced various <strong>career opportunities</strong> available within PPG
and the broader coating and chemical industries. Potential career paths include chemical
engineering, materials science, research and development (R&amp;D), quality control,
production management, and technical sales. This exposure helped me better understand
how my studies can be applied in real industrial settings.



Overall, the PPG Industry Talk was <strong>informative and eye-opening</strong>. It broadened my
perspective on how paints and coatings contribute to safety, sustainability, and
technological advancement. The session also motivated me to explore future career
opportunities in materials science, chemical technology, and industrial innovation.
